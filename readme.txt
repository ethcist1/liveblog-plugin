A simple native WordPress liveblogging plugin to post multiple updates to a single blog post.

== Description ==
Embed a liveblog on any WordPress post and post breaking news updates as they unfold. 

Readers and site visitors will automatically see latest news items without needing to refresh the page, as the liveblog section automatically refreshes at regular intervals.

Benefits include:
- Simple experience for creating new liveblogs, adding them to a post using a shortcode, and then posting liveblog updates using the familiar WordPress posting experience - no external tools or accounts required.
- Define custom refresh intervals
- Add custom CSS to style posts any way you like
- Include custom HTML at predefined intervals between the posts, perfect for loading additional ads.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder.
2. Go to the **Plugins** page and activate the plugin.
3. A new menu item will appear in the dashboard menu called \\\"Liveblog\\\".
4. Visit the LIveblog sub-menu to create your first liveblog category 
5. Give your specific liveblog a name (e.g. Election coverage 2024). Once saved, a shortcode will be created which you can copy and paste into any WordPress post. 
6. Visit \\\"New Liveblog Item\\\" and create a new post. Make sure you assign the post to the liveblog category you created. Posts can support images, and 3rd party embeds, like any other WordPress post.
7. Visit the settings page to configure the liveblog settings - add custom CSS to style individual components, define how frequently the liveblog will refresh, and insert any code between liveblog items.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Do I need to have a 3rd party account or software to run this?
No, unlike other liveblogging tools, all your liveblogs are created and stored right inside your existing WordPress site; create a liveblog post is almost identical to creating any other WordPress post.

How do I style the shortcode?
You can use custom CSS styles to give the liveblogs any style you\\\'d like. Each liveblog item has a class called \\\".liveblog-item\\\", which you can use to style the entire post, or add more detail by specifying things like \\\".liveblog-item h2\\\"
